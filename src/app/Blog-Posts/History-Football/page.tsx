Here’s how soccer became the world's favorite sport."

It brings together people from all walks of life, offers a platform for showcasing national pride, and continues to grow as both a sport and a global business. The beauty of soccer lies not only in the game itself but in the way it connects people across cultures, languages, and continents, making it a universal language of sport."
